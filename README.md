Hello, I'm Joshua

Currently I am working on getting proficient at Frontend Development

In university I was more or less conscripted into getting proficient with C/C++ and Assembler and to a lesser degree C#, Ada, VHDL, MySQL.... y'know, the real low level stuff, unironically moving ones and zeroes for days until you feel the stomach ulcers forming.

An experience that has made me more eager to jump head first into less hardware close projects like web development using HTML/CSS/Typescript and web scraping/automation with Python.
